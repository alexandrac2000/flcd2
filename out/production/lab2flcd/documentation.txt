I defined some lists representing  separators, operators and reserved words.
I also have  methods that determine if something is an identifier or a constant .
One function that splits a given str into tokens that are delimited by separators or operators.
In the "scan" method I initialize an empty symbol table and the PIF.
I represent the PIF as a list that contains a string ("identifier" , "constant" and the token itself otherwise),
and the position in the symbol table(as integers).
I go in the program line by line.
i take a line, I split it into tokens and check the type of the token and insert it into the PIF.
If the token is an identifier or a constant I put the position from the symbol table in the PIF,
 otherwise I insert the position (-1, -1) in the PIF.
In the end I return a "TableEntityStructure" containing the symbol table and the PIF.
If there are any lexical error, the programme throws an error specifying the token at which the error was met
and where.
